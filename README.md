# Spotlight

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.com
```

Next, run the development server:

## License

Parts of this site are licensed under the [Tailwind UI license](https://tailwindui.com/license).

## TODO

- [] Merge this license with the TailwindUI license... Check on whether I technically can open source this code considering it's mostly TailwindUI

- [] Landing Page -- The pictures are currently links for the testimonials.  They should be in the resources.
- [] Landing Page -- Update dimensions and formatting for testimonials
- [] Landing Page -- Decide to use quotes from the hype sheet of GCISO, IQPMC, Gartner, etc. Maybe replace HBH with TSG CFO


## Thoughts

- Clients section.  In the experience area differentiate between "Industry" and "Consulting" with industry having Home Depot, HP, etc, specifying as a security leader architect and CISO on the side.  Consulting can include the HP clients -- DLA, NMCI, GFEBS, Express Scripts, GSA, Homeland Security, ICE.  Also can have a "Mentoring and Advisory" section that includes "People from" and include GCISO, Ismail, and Laura??
